# Vegetation Analysis Tool
## Overview
This tool is designed for analyzing vegetation using various remote sensing data and geospatial variables. It utilizes Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Sentinel satellite data for the period from January to April 2020. The analysis primarily focuses on the following variables:
- Vegetation Index (NDVI)
- Solar Radiance
- Elevation (DEM)
- Slope Angle
- Aspect
- Plan Curvature
- Topographic Wetness Index
- Land Surface Temperature
- Leaf Area Index
- Crown Area
- Chlorophyll Content
## Requirements
- Access to Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform
- Python environment with necessary packages (e.g., geemap, folium, matplotlib)
- Internet connection for accessing Sentinel satellite data
### Note
- Ensure proper citation and compliance with licensing terms when using Sentinel data.
- Adjust parameters and methods according to the specific research questions or objectives.
- Refer to the documentation of the used packages and platforms for detailed information on functions and capabilities.
